# meeple-matcher
This project will recommend board games to gamers based on their current collection and stated interests, as described in their online gaming profile on [BoardGameGeek](https://www.boardgamegeek.com) (BGG).

It's my capstone project for the [Foundations of Data Science](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science/) workshop at [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com).

You can read the [project proposal](https://github.com/mikec964/meeple-matcher/blob/master/project_proposal.Rmd) on github.

The source code (and this proposal) are stored on [github](https://github.com/mikec964/meeple-matcher).

Sample reports will be stored on [rpubs](http://rpubs.com/mike3d0g).
